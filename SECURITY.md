# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

GrokParty Web is currently pre-release. The `main` branch receives security fixes on a best-effort basis until formal versioning begins.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

1. Email the maintainers at `security@grokparty.dev` (replace with your actual contact address before publishing).
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce, impacted components, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
3. Allow up to 72 hours for an initial response. We will coordinate a remediation plan and disclosure timeline with you.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security concerns until a fix is released.

## Disclosure Expectations

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report and keep you informed of progress.
- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a disclosure window before public release when possible.
- Researchers who follow this policy will be credited in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
