# AI Output Disclaimer and Conditions of Use

Effective date: 2025-09-21

This document explains the limits of responsibility for the GrokParty chatbot project ("the App"). It is informational and not legal advice. It supplements, and does not replace, the AGPL-3.0 License and any Terms of Service included in this repository or user interface.

## 1) Purpose and Scope
- Clarifies that outputs come from third‑party AI services you choose and configure.
- Allocates responsibility for use and consequences to you and to the model providers—not to the App author(s).
- Sets conditions of use. If you disagree, do not use the App.

## 2) Definitions
- **App**: The GrokParty client‑side interface and accompanying materials.
- **LLMs/Providers**: Third‑party large language models and services (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) that you connect with your own credentials.
- **Outputs**: Any text, images, audio, or tool actions generated or triggered by the models.
- **You**: Any user, administrator, or organization using or distributing the App.

## 3) Nature of the Service
- The App helps you compose and send prompts to models you select.
- You supply and control your own API keys and provider choices.
- The App may include a system prompt template; it does not create, host, or operate any models.
- Any defects, harms, or errors attributable to model behavior are the responsibility of the model providers and of the users who choose to act on Outputs.

## 4) No Responsibility for Model Outputs
- You acknowledge that Outputs are generated by third‑party models not developed, controlled, or operated by the App author(s).
- The App author(s) are not responsible for any content, actions, decisions, or consequences arising from Outputs, regardless of the prompt templates provided.
- If you disagree with this allocation of responsibility, you are not permitted to use the App.

## 5) No Professional or Emergency Use
- Outputs are not a substitute for professional advice (medical, legal, financial, engineering, safety, etc.).
- Do not use the App or Outputs for crisis response, life‑support, or any safety‑critical context.
- If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact local emergency services or an appropriate hotline. Do not rely on the App or any AI model for crisis intervention.

## 6) Personal Responsibility and User Duties
- Exercise independent judgment; review and verify Outputs before use.
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and provider terms.
- Do not input sensitive or confidential information unless you accept the risks.
- You are solely responsible for your prompts, Outputs you choose to act on, and any downstream use or publication.

## 7) Parenting, Guardianship, and Youth Use
- Not child‑directed: The App is not designed for children and may produce content inappropriate for minors.
- Minors require supervision: A parent or legal guardian must provide direct, active oversight and is fully responsible for any minor’s use, including reviewing Outputs prior to use.
- Guardian duties: Use device‑level controls, restrict unsafe providers, enable safety filters where available, and teach critical evaluation of AI Outputs.
- Schools/organizations: Do not deploy to youth settings without policies, training, supervision, and legal compliance (e.g., student privacy, parental consent). The App author(s) assume no duty of care.

## 8) Examples of Risk Scenarios (Non‑Exhaustive)
- **Self‑harm and mental health**: AI interactions are not a substitute for professional help. Seek qualified assistance; do not rely on the App for crisis support.
- **Harmful/illegal instructions**: Models may generate unsafe or unlawful guidance. You are responsible for preventing misuse and for actions you take.
- **Defamation and reputational harm**: Verify facts before sharing any AI‑generated statements.
- **Professional error**: Outputs may be inaccurate for specialized domains. Consult qualified professionals.
- **Safety‑critical errors**: Do not use for emergency response, life‑support, or contexts where errors could cause injury, death, or significant damage.
- **Privacy and data security**: Prompts/Outputs may be transmitted to or stored by providers. Review provider privacy policies; avoid sharing secrets.
- **Intellectual property**: Outputs may resemble copyrighted or proprietary content. Ensure you have rights before using or distributing.
- **Bias/offensive content**: Models may produce biased or harmful content. Apply your standards and filters.
- **Tool calling and automation**: If enabled, tools may act on model instructions. Validate inputs/outputs and accept responsibility for results.

## 9) Third‑Party Terms and Data Handling
- Your use of any provider is subject to that provider’s terms, policies, and rate limits.
- The App does not control provider logging, retention, or data usage. Review each provider’s documentation and privacy policy.

## 10) Prohibited Uses
- Do not use the App for harassment, bullying, exploitation, stalking, discrimination, or other harmful conduct.
- Do not target minors or vulnerable individuals.
- Do not use the App to violate laws or third‑party rights.

## 11) Allocation of Risk, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification
- The App is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App author(s) disclaim all liability for any claim, loss, or damage arising from or related to Outputs or your use of the App.
- You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the App author(s), contributors, and maintainers from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising out of or related to your use of the App, your prompts, your reliance on Outputs, or your violation of laws or third‑party rights.

## 12) Acceptance and Conditions of Use
- By using the App, you confirm that you have read and agree to this disclaimer.
- If you do not agree, you must not use the App.

## 13) Updates
This document may be updated over time. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
