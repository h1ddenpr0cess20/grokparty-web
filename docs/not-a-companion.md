# Not a Companion — Please Read

**GrokParty** is a web‑based, multi‑character conversation platform that lets you explore ideas, prototype workflows, generate content, and integrate with AI services. It is explicitly **not** intended to be a “companion,” “friend,” therapist, or romantic partner.

## Why this policy exists
- **Clarity of purpose**: GrokParty focuses on creativity, productivity, and learning — not on simulating personal relationships.
- **Boundaries matter**: AI isn’t a person. Treating it as such can create unhealthy parasocial dynamics, which the maintainers do not endorse.
- **Product direction**: Feature development is prioritized for building tools, workflows, and integrations, not for emulating intimacy.

## If you were planning to use it as a companion
Consider this a polite‑but‑pointed nudge: please don’t. If you find yourself spinning up a “romance” persona or crafting long backstories to fill a social gap, that’s a sign to pause. Close the tab, take a walk, call a friend, join a community, or go make something cool. You’ll thank yourself later.

## Intended uses
- **Creative drafting and ideation** – generate text, code snippets, or design concepts.
- **Research assistance and tool calling** – leverage built‑in tools (e.g., web search, image generation) to augment queries.
- **Prototyping workflows and integrations** – experiment with multi‑character dialogues, custom prompts, and API key management.
- **Learning, debugging, and exploration** – use the setup wizard and conversation controls to understand model behavior.
- **Local/private experimentation** – run the app entirely in the browser without a server, keeping data client‑side.

## Not intended uses
- **Companionship, romance, or simulated intimacy** – the app is not a substitute for human relationships.
- **Emotional dependency or therapy replacement** – do not rely on GrokParty for mental‑health support.
- **Anything that treats the model as a person** – avoid anthropomorphizing the AI or presenting it as a sentient entity.

Thank you for respecting the project’s boundaries and intent.
